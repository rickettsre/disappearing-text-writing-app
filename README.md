# disappearing-text-writing-app
A Tkinter app that deletes all text written so far if the user stops typing for 5 seconds

Day 90
============
One of the most interesting solutions to this is a web app called The Most Dangerous Writing App, an online text editor where if you stop writing, all your progress will be lost.

A timer will count down and when the website detects the user has not written anything in the last 5/10 seconds, it will delete all the text they've written so far.

Try it out here:

You are going to build a desktop app that has similar functionality. The design is up to you, but it should allow a user to type and if they stop for more than 5 seconds, it should delete everything they've written so far.
